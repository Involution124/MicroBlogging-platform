Microblogging platform written with Node.js and Express

TODO:

	* Integrate sessions (figure out a way to use helpers so we don't need to pass loggedin as an argument every call to render() ) 
	* Get the rest of the partials drawn up
	* <strike>Integrate Mongo, create DB structure</strike> Nearly done, need to figure out a better way to export db handler
	* Write the partials, Jquery for Async interaction
	* Create home section with posting functionality 
	* Admin section?
